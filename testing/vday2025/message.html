            Happy Valentine's Day, my love!
            <br><br>
            I just want to thank you for everything. Thank you for loving me in ways I never knew I needed, for caring for me even when I struggle to care for myself, supporting me in every step of the way, and for simply being there for me. You make me feel safe, and feel like I can live again and hope for a future with you.
            <br><br>
            I also want to let you know that I appreciate everything you've done for me, and even perhaps for my family. Thank you for your patience, for the way you call me out when I need to grow, and for always believing in me. Your love doesn‚Äôt just make me happy; it makes me a better person.
            <br><br>
            Some of my most treasured memories are from when you were here‚Äîwhen, for a little while, we got to share a home, wake up together, and just exist side by side. I miss that. I miss you. And I can‚Äôt wait for the day when we won‚Äôt have to count down the days until we‚Äôre together again, because we‚Äôll just be together.
            <br><br>
            Please help me pronounce your name lol. And help me learn Czech so I can at least talk to your family and the people around you.
            <br><br>
            I love you always. I will keep working hard‚Äînot just for you, but for myself as well, and for us.
            <br><br>
            Yours truly,
            <br>
            Abby
