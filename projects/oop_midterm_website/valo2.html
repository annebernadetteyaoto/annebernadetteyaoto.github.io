        <hr>
        <p class="font-general"><b>Sage's POV</b></p>
        <p class="font-general">Resurrecting Cypher had never been easy. Not because he was hard to bring back to life, but rather the fact that he always seems so haunted whenever he wakes up.</p>
        <p class="font-general">The first time she resurrected him was the hardest of them all. She remembered him lying on the bed as she revived him. When she asked him what he was feeling, she was scared that she had done more harm than good when he hadn't answered for a while. When he did, what he said sent chills through her spine.</p>
        <p class="font-general"><em>"For a moment, I saw them."</em></p>
        <p class="font-general">Them. She could only assume he meant his family. The reason why he kept pestering her about her resurrection powers. He wanted his family back.</p>
        <p class="font-general">She didn't know what to say. What would you tell someone who had lost everything, getting them back, only to lose them all over again?</p>
        <p class="font-general">He didn't speak to anyone for the rest of the day. No one saw even a shadow of him, even after she had dismissed him from the med bay. She could only assume that he had locked himself in his room for the rest of the day.</p>
        <p class="font-general">She couldn't blame him.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="font-general"><b>Killjoy's POV</b></p>
        <p class="font-general">It was odd not seeing Cypher playing chess by himself in the corner of the lounge room. He had gotten used to the sight of the masked man observing everyone and speaking out of the blue.</p>
        <p class="font-general">But he saw no sight of Cypher on his usual corner. Or anywhere in the base, for that matter. Maybe it's because he had died in the mission? Maybe Sage kept him under observation in the med bay.</p>
        <p class="font-general">Just then, he saw Sage enter the lounge room and look at where Cypher would normally be, quipping at how she should try drinking Moroccan mint tea instead of her usual Chinese herbal tea. </p>
        <p class="font-general">"KJ, have you seen Cypher anywhere?" Sage asked when she noticed her in the room.</p>
        <p class="font-general">Killjoy frowned. "No, I haven't seen him since before he went on the mission. I've been meaning to show him some of the blueprints I've made, but he wasn't in the workshop either, and you know that his room is out of bounds from everyone."</p>
        <p class="font-general">Sage looked worried and Killjoy wondered what happened.</p>
        <p class="font-general">"If you see him, tell him that my office is always open if he wants to talk," Sage said before leaving the room, not even bothering to make her tea.</p>
        <p class="font-general">Killjoy was left to worriedly wonder what happened as she finished her coffee and went back to the workshop.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="font-general">The next day, she found Cypher deep into his work in the workshop as if nothing happened. There was a cup beside him, and from the smell of it, it seemed like Arabic coffee.</p>
        <p class="font-general">"Good morning, Cypher," Killjoy yawned into her own cup as she got to her table, which is right beside her girlfriend's.</p>
        <p class="font-general">Cypher just grunted as he finished typing something on his computer and went to print them.</p>
        <p class="font-general">Killjoy frowned. Normally, Cypher would greet back or say something sassy. "Sage was looking for you yesterday, she said that her office is always open if you wanna talk."</p>
        <p class="font-general">"There's nothing to talk about," Cypher simply said as he took the stack of papers and walked out of the room, barely dodging Raze.</p>
        <p class="font-general">"What is wrong with that guy?" The duelist asked her girlfriend.</p>
        <p class="font-general">"I don't know, Raze. I don't know either."</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="font-general"><b>Cypher's POV</b></p>
        <p class="font-general">Grief. Crushing grief. He doesn't remember it hurting so much the first time around.</p>
        <p class="font-general">He had accepted it. He had accepted death. He was happy that he'll finally be with his family again.</p>
        <p class="font-general">What had Nora said? Take care of your new family, Amir. But how could he take care of his new family when he knew he failed his old one?</p>
        <p class="font-general">Gritting his teeth, he set down the papers on Brimstone's desk and rushed back to the workshop to continue his work.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="font-general"><b>Killjoy's POV</b></p>
        <p class="font-general">"Sage, I'm worried about Cypher."</p>
        <p class="font-general">Normally, KJ wouldn't bother with this, but Cypher kept giving her the cold shoulder. She didn't even know what she had done to him. Sure, she knows that she has an ego larger than Jupiter, but so does he, and he even jokes about it with her.</p>
        <p class="font-general">But now? All he does is work, work, and work. Not even Killjoy was that workaholic (well, she used to, until Raze started dragging her from the workshop to touch some grass). She doubts he even sleeps cause he's working before she's even there, and still works even after she had retired for the night. Even she knew that wasn't even relatively healthy.</p>
        <p class="font-general">"I know," Sage sighed as she made her tea.</p>
        <p class="font-general">They were once again in the lounge area, enjoying the peace and quiet. It was too early for most of the agents to be awake, leaving only her, Sage, Brimstone, Cypher, and Viper awake at this time.</p>
        <p class="font-general">"Has he been eating?" Sage asked Killjoy, to which she shrugged.</p>
        <p class="font-general">"I honestly don't know, Raze has been dragging me for meals every single time and Cypher never joined once ever since he got back from that mission."</p>
        <p class="font-general">"That's what I'm worried about." Sage stood up and went out of the room, Killjoy following behind.</p>
        <p class="font-general">"Where are we going?" KJ asked.</p>
        <p class="font-general">"To the workshop. He's been holed up there for nearly five days. I'm dragging him out." Sage answered shortly.</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="font-general"><b>Cypher's POV</b></p>
        <p class="font-general">Cypher felt horrible. He felt weak, and on more than one occasion, he fell asleep unknowingly and only woke up because his head hit the keyboard. He was also trembling and could barely hold his cup of coffee this morning. He knew he should rest, but he needed to gather more information from the last mission which, due to being dead, he was not able to do.</p>
        <p class="font-general">The door of the workshop suddenly opened and he jumped from his seat.</p>
        <p class="font-general">"Sage, Killjoy, you nearly gave me a heart attack." Cypher didn't know if he was joking or angry at them, but his heart was pounding hard against his chest, and he struggled to get his breathing under control.</p>
        <p class="font-general">Sage noticed this and her face softened, but her words were firm. "Cypher, med bay. Now."</p>
        <p class="font-general">He knew he couldn't argue against Sage, but he was too tired. Too tired to stand up, too tired to even keep himself awake. His heart pounded along with his head, and his eyes blurred over the two figures at the doorway.</p>
        <p class="font-general">"Cypher!"</p>
        <hr>
        <p class="font-general">For the second time in a month, Cypher woke up in the med bay, confused as to how he ended up there. That's when he saw the dextrose hooked to his arm.</p>
        <p class="font-general">"I had to manually give you fluids cause no amount of my healing will cure dehydration," Sage said from his other side. "And your organs failed. Twice. Amir, what the fuck were you doing to yourself?"</p>
        <p class="font-general">Cypher winced. It must be really bad if Sage was cursing at him.</p>
        <p class="font-general">"How long was I out?" he asked hoarsely, like his mouth was crying for water.</p>
        <p class="font-general">"3 days. Your body was failing when we got you here." Sage handed him a glass of water with a straw. "Drink that slowly."</p>
        <p class="font-general">The water felt good. As much as Cypher wanted to drink greedily, he obeyed Sage. No reason to piss her off even more.</p>
        <p class="font-general">When the glass was empty, Sage took it back to the sink. That's when Cypher realized that his mask was missing, and his eyes widened in alarm.</p>
        <p class="font-general">“If you’re worried about me seeing your face, remember that I’ve already seen it when you first joined, so has Viper and Brimstone,” Sage explained. “No one other than me was able to see your face during the time you stayed here.”</p>
        <p class="font-general">Cypher let out a sigh of relief as he weakly adjusted himself to a sitting position.</p>
        <p class="font-general">“Cypher,” Sage said seriously. “You don’t have to tell me what’s wrong. But you need to take care of yourself. You can’t do your job properly if you can’t even take care of yourself.”</p>
        <p class="font-general"><em>“You don’t have to tell me what’s wrong, Amir. But you need to take care of yourself more. How can you take care of us if you can’t even take care of yourself?”</em></p>
        <p class="font-general">Cypher jolted as he heard his wife’s voice in his head- a memory of when Nora had said nearly the exact same thing to him when he had overworked himself to the point of collapsing on his wife.</p>
        <p class="font-general"><em>“But Nora, I needed that information,” he argued back. “The guy was willing to pay a lot of money for that information, and we needed that money.”</em></p>
        <p class="font-general"><em>“Money isn’t everything, Amir,” she argued back. “What would happen to us if you died? Our daughter won’t have a father to grow up with. I won’t have a husband to grow old with. I’d rather take being poor than losing you, Amir.”</em></p>
        <p class="font-general">Amir felt something wet drop on his thighs. Reaching up to his face with one hand, he realized he was crying.</p>
        <p class="font-general">“Cypher? What’s wrong? Did I say something?”</p>
        <p class="font-general">Sage looked worried. She reminded him of how his wife would worry about him about the simplest things.</p>
        <p class="font-general">Sage wasn’t Nora. But what had Nora said? <em>Take care of your new family, Amir.</em> Sage is his new family now. Not just Sage, but also Killjoy, Sova, Viper, Brimstone, and basically everyone else in the protocol.</p>
        <p class="font-general"><em>I must survive to protect my family,</em> he thought. <em>I can’t lose them. I can’t feel that pain again.</em></p>
        <hr>
        <p class="font-general">When Cypher got dismissed by Sage a few days later (with a note that he has to be present at every meal, honestly what does she think he is, five?), he ran into Killjoy on his way to the workshop.</p>
        <p class="font-general">“And where are you going, mister?” Killjoy raised an eyebrow at him.</p>
        <p class="font-general">“Little engineer,” he said with a smile, “I was just on my way to collect my stuff from the workshop before dinner.”</p>
        <p class="font-general">“And do you plan on doing your stuff?”</p>
        <p class="font-general">Damn, he must’ve scared her badly if she’s acting like this. “Not until tomorrow, my little engineer. I plan on catching up on sleep tonight. The bed in the med bay isn’t really as comfortable as my own bed,” he replied smoothly.</p>
        <p class="font-general">And then Killjoy started punching his chest.</p>
        <p class="font-general">“Woah, hey! Killjoy, what’s wrong with you?” Cypher asked in surprise, grunting with every impact. For a tech woman, she has a strong punch.</p>
        <p class="font-general">Cypher’s eyes caught Raze’s, who was leaning on the wall with her boombot in hand.</p>
        <p class="font-general"><em>Get your girlfriend,</em> he mouthed at her.</p>
        <p class="font-general">Raze shook her head. <em>Let her get it out of her system,</em> she mouthed back before turning away, leaving the two in the corridor.</p>
        <p class="font-general">“Never- do- that- to- me- ever- again-” Killjoy gasped out in between tears and punches.</p>
        <p class="font-general">Cypher hesitated before putting his arms around the smaller girl, effectively stopping her from punching his poor ribs (Sage will have his head if he went back to her with bruised or broken ribs), and just letting her cry against him.</p>
        <p class="font-general">“Little engineer,” he murmured. “I’m sorry for scaring you, but I promise that won’t happen again.”</p>
        <p class="font-general">“You better,” Killjoy sniffed as Cypher let her go. “Also if you tell anyone about this, I will hack Brimstone’s arm and blame it on you. Deal?”</p>
        <p class="font-general">Cypher laughed. “Deal.”</p>
        <p class="font-general">Seeing his family might have opened a wound he had long forgotten, but they had reminded him that in their absence, he had made a new family. It would still be hard seeing them whenever he dies, but over time, he had hopes that it would get easier.</p>
